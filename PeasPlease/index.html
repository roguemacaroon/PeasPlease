            <span class="PopupText" id="MyPopup">Did you know that peas are fascinating? Here are 3 FREE and FUN facts
                about peas! (Click to close) <ol>
                    <li>Ancient History: Peas have been around for a long time! They've been cultivated for over
                        7,000 years and were a staple food in ancient civilizations like Greece, Egypt, and Rome.</li>
                    <li>Fixing Nitrogen: Peas are part of a special group of plants known as legumes. They have a unique
                        ability
                        to fix nitrogen in the soil, thanks to a symbiotic relationship with bacteria in their root
                        nodules.
                        This enriches the soil, benefitting other plants nearby.
                    </li>
                    <li>Variety Galore: There's an amazing variety of peas beyond the typical green ones you might see
                        in the
                        grocery store. There are snow peas (with edible pods), snap peas (a cross between snow peas and
                        garden
                        peas), and even purple peas, each with its unique taste and culinary uses.</li>
